# Simple Scripts

These are just some scripts that I use on my local device. The most used are boot and rmt. Look around!

This is the current layout of the repo. It is pretty self-explanatory, but refer to the README in each folder to learn more(TODO). Within the boot and rmt projects, I use the [Cobra library](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to help make powerful cli tools with ease. Please refer to the cobra repo for more information on how to use the tool and how to read the directory structure.
